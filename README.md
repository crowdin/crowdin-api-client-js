## Requirements
* typescript 3.5.2
* tslint 5.18.0
* ts-jest 24.0.2
* (optional) jest 24.8.0
* (optional) jest-circus 24.8.0

## Dependencies
* Axios 0.19

## Installation
npm [TBA]

## Quick Start

Start using client by creating `Credentials` object:

```typescript
import * as crowdin from 'crowdin-sdk-2';

const credentials: crowdin.Credentials = {
    token: 'testToken',
    organization: 'organizationName'
};
```

### List of projects

```typescript
const projectsGroupsApi = new crowdin.ProjectsGroups.Api(credentials);

const projects = await projectsGroupsApi.listProjects();
```

Or you can create whole client and use needed APIs:

```typescript
const client = new crowdin.Client(credentials);

const { projectsGroupsApi } = client;

const projects = await projectsGroupsApi.listProjects();
```

### List of projects with Fetch API

In addition if you use client in non-Node.js environment you might have a troubles with http calls.
This client uses [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) which internally uses `http` and `https` Node modules.
So there is an option to use http client based on [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

```typescript
const projectsGroupsApi = new crowdin.ProjectsGroups.Api(credentials, {
    httpClientType: crowdin.HttpClientType.FETCH
});

const projects = await projectsGroupsApi.listProjects();
```

Or even pass your own http client as `httpClient` property which should implement `crowdin.HttpClient` interface.
